## Data

We'll be using data from Kaggle in three common formats: CSV, XLSX, JSON, and XML

### CSV and XLSX Data Sample

The [Rainfall of Iranian Cities](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohammadrahdanmofrad/average-monthly-precipitation-of-iranian-cities?select=Rainfall_Iran_19012022.csv)
datasets provides monthly precipitation data for 31 cities in Iran from 1901 to 2022 in Command Separated Value (CSV)
and Excel Spreadsheet (XLSX) formats.

### JSON
[The Warship Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/queyrusi/the-warship-dataset) includes 40 years of Heavy-Class
warship data from Russia, Turky, and the United States.

### XML
The [India City Air Quality Index](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kdsharmaai/india-city-air-quality-index?select=India_city_polution_data.xml)
dataset is a good example of nested XML with several features at each tag level.

### Data Cleaning
We'll walk through the five [Kaggle Data Cleaning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/data-cleaning) datasets to see how we
can not only revisit common data engineering tasks but then transition them to automated workflows instead of standalone
Jupyter Notebooks.
